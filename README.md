# PPG Live Monitor — React Native (Android)

Real-time PPG (Photoplethysmography) signal viewer for Android. Connects to a **NanoESP32_PPG** Arduino device over BLE and displays live waveform data with minimal latency.

## BLE Protocol

| Parameter        | Value                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Device Name      | `NanoESP32_PPG`                                |
| Service UUID     | `6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`        |
| TX Char UUID     | `6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`        |
| Notification     | 25 packets/sec, 4 comma-separated ints each    |
| Effective Rate   | 100 Hz (4 samples × 25 notifications)          |
| Value Range      | 0–4095 (12-bit ADC)                            |
| Data Format      | `"1234,2345,3456,4567\n"` (UTF-8, CSV)         |

## Low-Latency Design

- **BLE Connection Priority**: `ConnectionPriority.High` requested immediately after connect (shortest BLE interval)
- **MTU**: Requested 185 bytes to eliminate fragmentation overhead
- **No React state for data**: PPG samples stored in a `useRef` buffer — zero re-renders from incoming data
- **Skia canvas rendering**: GPU-accelerated drawing via `@shopify/react-native-skia` — bypasses React Native's bridge entirely
- **30 fps redraw loop**: `requestAnimationFrame` drives chart updates, decoupled from BLE notification rate
- **Minimal parsing**: Direct `split(',')` + `parseInt` on decoded base64 — no regex

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **Android Studio** with SDK 34+ and NDK installed
- **Java JDK** 17
- An Android device (physical) with BLE support — emulators don't support BLE

### Environment Variables (Windows)

```
ANDROID_HOME = C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17
```

Ensure `platform-tools` is on your PATH.

## Setup

```bash
cd PPGMonitor
npm install
```

## Running

1. Connect your Android phone via USB (enable USB debugging)
2. Verify device is detected:
   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```
3. Build and run:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

## Building a Release APK

To generate and install a release APK:

1. (First time only) Generate a signing key and configure it in `android/app/build.gradle` and `android/gradle.properties` (see React Native docs for details).
2. Build the release APK:
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```
3. The APK will be output to:
   ```
   android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
   ```
4. To install the APK on your device via USB:
   ```bash
   adb install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
   ```
5. The app will now appear in your app drawer, ready to use.
4. Power on the Arduino Nano ESP32 with the pulse sensor
5. Tap **Connect** in the app
6. Place your finger on the pulse sensor — the PPG waveform appears in real time

## Key Dependencies

| Package                       | Purpose                            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `react-native-ble-plx`       | BLE scanning, connect, notify      |
| `@shopify/react-native-skia`  | GPU-accelerated chart rendering    |
| `react-native-reanimated`     | Required peer dep for Skia         |

## Corresponding Source Files

- **Arduino firmware**: `arduino_code/src/bluetooth.cpp` — sensor read + BLE notify
- **Python reference viewer**: `python_code/data_viewer.py` — desktop BLE viewer (same protocol)

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| "Scan timeout" | Ensure Arduino is powered and advertising. Check it's not connected to another device. |
| "Permissions denied" | Go to Android Settings → Apps → PPGMonitor → Permissions → enable Location & Nearby Devices |
| Flat line / no data | Verify finger is on sensor. Check Arduino serial output for ADC readings. |
| Choppy chart | Ensure phone isn't in battery saver mode (throttles BLE interval). |
| Build fails on Skia | Run `cd android && ./gradlew clean` then rebuild. |
